Introduction
The Job Application Management System is a web-based application designed to help job seekers manage their job applications efficiently. Users can track the status of their applications, store job-related details, and manage their profiles. This application is built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) to provide a robust and scalable solution.
